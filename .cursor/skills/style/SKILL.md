# Overview

Use tailwindcss for all css and styling of the project. Use the best practices according to the latest tailwindcss version. Mimic styles existing in the project such as primary, secondary, and tertiary colors; text colors, fonts, and sizes; avoid rounded edges and use a retro flat style design for the entire project. The project will have many screens that are mainly different dashboards. Screens should be user-friendly and intuitive to use. Anything that is beyond intuitive should have instructions available such as an information circle to click on.
